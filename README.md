# HatanoNelsonBoomerang

In this Python code I compute the quantum boomerang effect (QBE) in the Hatano-Nelson model of one-dimentional lattices [1]. The code contains several options of parallelization for speed up (see lines 97-125).

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The input parameters are given in lines 16-27.
2. The desired number of cores is chosen in line 14.
3. The program generates figures that shows the QBE.
